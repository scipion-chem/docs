Supplementary workflow (1a28_workflow)
###############################################################
This section contains a VDS supplementary for the VDS Scipion-chem publication for `D-COID <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8czn4rxz68/1>`_ database for `1A28 <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1A28>`_ PDB entry, with a few variations from the 4ERF example.
The same pattern ( <Subworkflow number> ) <Plugin> - <Task performed> ) is used to describe identify the subworkflow each of the protocols belongs to. 
In this case, the subworkflows are:

1) Main VDS workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Principal workflow that includes protocols following the "VDS workflow" section:

   :alt: vds workflow 1a28

1) **Molecules import**
    - **Receptor import**: 1A28 structure from `D-COID <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8czn4rxz68/1>`_ database, corresponding to 1A28 PDB entry, the progesterone receptor
      linked to its ligand progesterone. The ligand is removed from the original structure in order to get the receptor
      structure.
    - **Small molecules import**: the 4 small molecule provided in the `D-COID <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8czn4rxz68/1>`_ database (DOI: 10.17632/8czn4rxz68.1) are
      imported from local files. These include the active molecule (progesterone) and 3 decoys which have been proved
      not to interact with the receptor.

2) **Molecules preparation**
    - **Receptor preparation**: we used Scipion-chem protocol (using biopython) to prepare the receptor, removing
      water and other heteroatoms.
    - **Small molecules preparation**: we used OpenBabel ligand preparation in order to add charges to the imported
      small molecules and generating up to 5 conformers for each of them.

3) **Molecules filtering**
    - **Ligand filtering**: RDKit ADME and PAINS filter protocols are executed over the input molecules (previously
      prepared with RDKit). The 4 of them pass the filters.

    - **Regions Of Interest definition**: set of protocols that tries to find the most promising regions of the
      receptor for interacting with the ligand. We did so by, first, independently predicting these receptor
      pockets with FPocket, P2Rank and AutoSite. Then, the results of each software are combined using the
      consensus protocol as explained in the paper. These resulting ROIs contain both the actual pocket of the
      progesterone and the same pocket in the dimer, which is not occupied in the actual structure, as shown in the
      figure in the paper related to this section.

4) **Docking**

   Prepared small molecules are docked onto the consensus ROIs. This task is performed independently using
   LeDock, AutoDock-GPU and Vina, with default parameters. Then, as explained in the paper, the results of
   these protocols are rescored using ODDT Vina, RFScore_v3 and NNScore. Finally, the rescored docking poses are
   combined and the most promising ones are extracted using the consensus protocol, with the different parameters
   explained in the paper. The name of the protocol specifies the parameters as: asking the clusters to contain x
   out of y input source poses (clut x/y) and with intra-cluster maximum RMSD of z (Rz).
   An additional protocol is added in this workflow to measure the RMSD distance of each of the docking poses to the
   actual ligand position.

5) **Molecular dynamics**

   The best 2 scored docking pose from the consensus docking protocol (which are the actual ligand, progesterone,
   according to all the tried scores) are used as input for the Molecular dynamics simulation example.
   Each of them come from a different pocket, but have similar scores, are stated in the paper.
   To do so, we used Desmond, from Schr√∂dinger. We used this commercial software because of the advanced trajectory
   analysis and the automatic ligand parametrization they provide.

   - System preparation: the docked molecule (together with the receptor) is surrounded by a water box
     (with 5A buffer) with the SPC water model. Na+ and Cl- are added to reach 0.15M concentration and
     neutralizing the system. S-OPLS main force field is used to parametrize the system.
   - Simulation: the prepared system is simulated in this protocol using Desmond. First, the system is
     minimized and equilibrated following the default Desmond procedure. Then, a small production simulation
     is executed, enlarging the trajectory with 24ps of unrestricted simulations.

2) Structural ROIs definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Scipion project also includes one example on how to determine structural ROIs based on mutations or variants
of the original receptor sequence and known binding residues.

|

3) Pharmacophore-based workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project includes the pharmacophore-based screening described in the paper.

To do so, the actual ligand of 1A28 is first extracted and a pharmacophore is generated from it. This pharmacophore
is used as a filter for out set of 4 small molecules. In this example, as the pharmacophore
features are built using RDKit, we prepared the small molecules using RDKit too. The only small molecule fitted into
the pharmacophore is the actual ligand, the progesterone, shown in the figure of the paper related to this section.

4) Molecular dynamics (MD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, this project also includes several examples of molecular dynamics simulations.

1) **On a docked molecule**

    As described in the "Main VDS workflow" section, two molecular dynamics simulation are
    performed using Desmond over the most promising docked molecules.

2) **Only on the receptor**

    Finally, a MD simulation is performed on the receptor only, this time using Gromacs. As for
    the previous cases, a first protocol is used to define the system, with the water box, ions and force fields; and a
    second protocol actually executes the simulation, which can be visualized using PyMol or VMD (recommended). Moreover,
    several Gromacs trajectory analysis can be executed from the Scipion GUI in the Analyze results option.
    However, the simulation is not executed in the project, since the resulting trajectory is composed by large files
    that could not be uploaded on GitHub, but the user is free to execute it locally.
