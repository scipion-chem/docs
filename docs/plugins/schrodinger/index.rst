Scipion-chem-schrodingerScipion overview
******************************************
`Schrodinger <https://www.schrodinger.com/>`_ is a platform that platform leverages a deep understanding of physics,
chemistry, and predictive modeling to accelerate innovation. It contains numerous tools for molecular modelling,
including drug discovery and molecular dynamics.

Scipion-chem-schrodingerScipion protocols
*******************************************

**1) Virtual Drug Screening**
================================

From Scipion-chem, we have included several tools from Schrodinger for Virtual Drug Screening in the following
protocols. The user will be able to prepare both the target and the ligands, predict or define the binding sites and
perform a docking analysis.

**Receptor preparation**
-------------------------------
This protocol prepares an AtomStruct object containing a protein file to make it ready for Schrodinger tools.
The protocol contains 4 sections with different parameters that define the receptor preparation, including protonation,
energy minimization, ionization and tautomerization. Internally, it uses the
`Prepwizard <https://www.schrodinger.com/science-articles/protein-preparation-wizard>`_ Schrodinger utility.

From Scipion-chem, we also provide the option of cleaning the structure from HETATM atoms and selecting specific
chains from the input structure.

An additional option is included to manually perform this receptor preparation using prepwizard
from Schrodinger's GUI.

All parameters include a help button that gives further information for each of them.

|

The result of this protocol is an AtomStruct object containing the resulting maestro file of the receptor, ready for
other Schrodinger tools.

A test for this protocol can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.main_wf.TestSchroProtPrep

|

**Ligand preparation**
-------------------------------
This protocol prepares a SetOfSmallMolecules to make it ready for Schrodinger tools. It includes different options
for ionization, building conformers and energy optimization. Internally, it uses the
`Ligprep <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/ligprep>`_ Schrodinger program.

|


.. image:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_form2.png
   :alt: schrodinger form2

|

The result of this protocol is another SetOfSmallMolecules object this time containing the maestro files ready for
other Schrodinger tools.

|

Tests for these protocols can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.main_wf.TestSchroLigPrep

|

**Binding site identification**
-------------------------------
This protocol predicts the most promising binding sites on the structure using
`SiteMap <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/sitemap>`_.

|

.. image:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_form3.png
   :alt: schrodinger form3
   :height: 400

|

The result of this protocol is a SetOfStructROIs (Structural Regions Of Interest), containing the predicted binding
sites. The user can visualize them using **Analyze Results**, which will display the General StructROIs viewer.

Tests for this protocol can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.main_wf.TestSitemap

This test contain the tests for Receptor Preparation described above.

|

**Grid generation**
-------------------------------
This protocol generates the grids used by the docking Schrodinger program:
`Glide <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/glide>`_. The protocol is currently
deprecated since all the necessary grids are internally generated by the glide docking protocol described below.
It might just be useful to generate and then check the resulting grids.

An additional option is included to manually define the Grids from Schrodinger's GUI.

All parameters include a help button that gives further information for each of them.

|

.. image:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_form4.png
   :alt: schrodinger form4

|

The result of this protocol is a SetOfSchrodingerGrids, around the specified site. Each grid is conformed by an inner
grid, where the center of mass of the ligand must be docked; and an outer grid, which must contains all the atoms of
the ligand. The user can visualize these grids using **Analyze Results**.

.. figure:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_out1_4.png
   :alt: schrodinger out1_4

A test for this protocol can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.main_wf.TestGridSchro

|

**Docking**
-------------------------------
This protocol uses `Glide <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/glide>`_ for docking a set of ligands to a receptor.
The docking can be performed on the whole protein
structure or on specific sites, which can be defines as a SetOfStructROIs or as a SetOfSchrodingerGrids.

    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.main_wf.TestGlideDocking

This test contain the tests for Receptor Preparation, Binding Site prediction, Grid Generation and Ligand Preparation
described above.

**2) Molecular dynamics**
================================

From Scipion-chem we added protocols able to handle Molecular Dynamics simulations in Schrodinger. The following
protocols allow the user to prepare, run and analyze these simulations.

**System preparation**
-------------------------------
This protocol prepares a Schrodinger MD system using
`Desmond <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/desmond>`_ prior to its simulation from a AtomStruct or a SmallMolecule object.
We recommend you to input the protein or ligand structures from a previous Schrodinger protocol. If the structure comes
from another plugin or a raw pdb, conversions will be attempted to adapt them to the Schrodinger format.

This protocol allows the user to create a solute boundary box, define the force field and finally specify the ions in
the solute, which can be set to neutralize the charges, or manually add the desired number.

This protocol also includes the functionality for preparing complexes containing non-protein atoms,
such as ligands, as Schrodinger takes care of the ligand parametrization itself.

All parameters include a help button that gives further information for each of them.

   :height: 425

|

A test for this protocol can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.md_wf.TestDesmondSysPrep

|

**Run MD simulation**
-------------------------------
This protocol takes the prepared Schrodinger system and uses
`Desmond <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/desmond>`_ to run a defined simulation. In the form, the user can
define different simulation stages that the protocol will run sequentially. The parameters of this protocol are grouped
as:

1) **Input**: The SchrodingerSystem product of the system preparation described above.

Then, the user can define the different MD stages:

2) **Simulation time**: Defines the length of the simulation in number of steps for the minimization and in time for NVT and NPT. In the case of NVT and NPT, the user can also specify whether the trajectory from the stage should be saved.

3) **Trajectory**: Defines the trajectory parameters and whether it should be saved.

4) **Ensemble**: Defines the type of simulation in the current stage. The user can choose from energy minimization, NVE, NVT, NPT... Then, for each of them other parameters will appear to further tune the simulation.

5) **Restraints**: Energetic restraints can be defined during the stage for the principal groups of atoms present in the system (Ligand, Protein, Solute, Heavy atoms...)

Then, the defined stage can be inserted into the workflow, whose summary is shown below.

5) **Summary**: A summary of the added stages is shown. However, this list is just a summary and manual modifications will not yield changes. In order to modify the stages, the user need to use the wizards in order to add, delete or watch the parameters of the desired stages, which can be specified in the wizard text input.

The user can also choose from a set of default workflows that will automatically be added to the summary when its wizard is used. Currently, only the default "NPT desmond relaxation" is included, which carries out a typical system relaxation.

|

The result of this protocol is a SchrodingerSystem, this time also containing the concatenated trajectory of the
last saved stages (If stages 2, 4 and 5 were saved, since we should not concatenate 2 to 4, only 4 and 5 will be saved).
Using **Analyze Results**, a form with different visualization options will be displayed, where the user can:

|

.. figure:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_out7_1.png
   :alt: schrodinger out7_1

|

1) **Open MD simulation**: Inspect the system trajectories of the different stages saved using Maestro.
|

.. figure:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_out7_2.png
   :alt: schrodinger out7_2

|

2) **Schrodinger Event Analysis**: Perform different analysis of the trajectories using Desmond. The user can choose whether to perform the complete set of analysis or a custom subset. Among these analysis it includes the variation of RMSD, RMSF, Gyration... of the different atom groups through the trajectory.

    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.md_wf.TestDesmondMD

This test contains the test for System Preparation described above.


**3) Utils**
================================

**Format conversion**
-------------------------------
This protocol uses Schrodinger scripts to convert an atomic structure or a set of small molecules to the desired format.
This protocol should not be necessary for Scipion-chem workflows since all conversions are handled internally,
but it might be used to generate some files that will be used externally.

|

.. image:: ../../../_static/images/schrodinger/schrodinger_form8.png
   :alt: schrodinger form8
   :height: 400

|

The result of this protocol is either an AtomStruct or a SetOfSmallMolecules, containing converted files in the desired
format. The user can access those files in the protocols folder (using "Browse" / folder icon).

Tests for this protocol can be run using::
    scipion3 tests schrodingerScipion.tests.test_utils.TestSchroConvert


**Fix structure**
-------------------------------
This protocol allows the user to use `Prime <https://www.schrodinger.com/products/prime>`_ for fixing an atomic
structure. The user can choose to minimize the hydrogens in the structure, predict and redefine a loop structure or
to predict and redefine the side chains of a set of residues. Wizards can be used to define the residues involved
in the two former options.

**Split structure**
-------------------------------
This protocol allows the user to use the *split_structure.py* scriptp from Schrodinger mmShare. It can be used to
split proteins, ligands or different chains inside the structure.
